        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Hi I’m Rashid, I’m 20 years old, and I was born in Florida but spent most of my life in the Charlotte area. This is my second semester here and I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2026 with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science and a concentration in software engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Pass</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated high school in 2022 and then started my college career at UNC Wilmington. I was there for two years until I decided to move back home and attend UNCC. Relevant courses I’ve taken include Data Structures and Algorithms, Logic and Algorithms, and Software Engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have used some of the concepts that we will go over in this course previously for other classes but never too in-depth. I am excited to obtain a better understanding of web development and its application in the real world.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 11 Laptops</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking and Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITCS-3160 Database Design and Implementation:</strong> It’s required for my degree but I am also interested in the concepts as I will most likely need it for my future career.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS-3135 Web Based Programming:</strong> I am interested in how web development actually works and its application in real life. I also want to get a better understanding of front-end development.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC-3146 Intro to Operating Systems and Networking:</strong> Also required for my degree but the concepts interest me.</li>
                    <li><strong>MATH-2164 Matrices and Linear Algebra:</strong> Required for my degree but it doesn’t seem as bad as previous math courses that I have taken.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> I am on the ultimate frisbee club here at UNCC.</li>
            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> I started playing the guitar about six months ago and have been consistent with it ever since.</li>
